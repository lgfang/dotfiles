This is global(default) ignore configuration. Modify =repo/.gitignore= for repo
specific ignores.

* Block pushing certain branches

To avoid accidentally push branches containing sensitive data, we can add a
pre-push to the corresponding repositories.

For example, to block myself from pushing my private configuration branches
=mine/company= to GitHub, I tangle (write) the following code snippet into
=~/.dotfiles/.git/hooks/pre-push= in with file permission =o755=.

#+begin_src bash :tangle ~/.dotfiles/.git/hooks/pre-push :tangle-mode o755
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  protected_branches=("mine" "company")

  # Read pushed refs from stdin (format: <local_ref> <local_sha> <remote_ref> <remote_sha>)
  while read -r local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha; do

      # Extract branch name from local_ref (e.g., refs/heads/company â†’ company)
      branch_name=$(basename "$local_ref" 2>/dev/null)

      # Check if the pushed branch is protected
      for protected in "${protected_branches[@]}"; do
          if [[ "$branch_name" == "$protected" ]]; then
              echo "Pushes to '$protected' are blocked by your pre-push hook." >&1
              exit 1
          fi
      done

  done

  exit 0
#+end_src

IMPORTANT:
- Ensure this file's permission is correct.
- Manually copy this file to designated directory if you clone the repository to
  a different place as this hook script itself is *not* copied over by =git
  clone=.
